# ffmpeg-wasm-vite-react-js

No env required; .nvmrc included so Node 16 is used. @ffmpeg/ffmpeg (wasm) won't work on other versions. You can just install deps and run vite. No special instructions.

This is a browser-only version of ffmpeg without any cors limitations so you don't need to control the web server and it's free (no api key from vendor or api gateway charges from aws).
